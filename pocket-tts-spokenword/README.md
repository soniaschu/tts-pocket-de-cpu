## Trying it from the website, without installing anything (origanl model interface NOT this GUI program)

Navigate to the https://kyutai.org/tts to try basic TTS functionality directly in your browser. You can input text, select different voices, and generate speech without any installation.

## Audiobook Generation Features

# Installation

Just a quick note.  I don't have time to properly update this.
I've included BAT files for installing and running the program under Windows.
I have a limited test environment for Windows but I was able to get this running without WSL.
You must have Python 3.12 and no higher installed in Windows for it to work.
How to install:
This project uses uv, an extremely fast Python package manager.

1. Install uv:
   
   - **Linux & Windows (WSL)**: Open your terminal and run:
     ```bash
     curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
     ```
     Note: After installation, you may need to restart your terminal or run `source $HOME/.local/bin/env` to add uv to your PATH.
   
   - **Windows (PowerShell)**: If you are using standard Windows PowerShell (not WSL), run:
     ```powershell
     powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
     ```

### Linux Installation

```bash
install.sh
```

**This will download all necessary files.  You will probably need to go to the [kyutai/pocket-tts · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/pocket-tts) page to accept TOS to download the model.  I suggest going there FIRST before running install.  FYI on first conversion there will be a delay as the model is downloaded.  This will take time depending on connection spped.

### Windows Installation

#### Option 1: Pre-built Installer (Recommended)

Download `Pocket-TTS-Setup.exe` from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/danneauxs/Pocket-TTS-Spokenword/releases/tag/v1.0.1) and run it. The installer will:

- Extract to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pocket TTS`
- Create Start Menu shortcuts
- On first launch, automatically download and install dependencies (~2-3 GB)



#### Option 2: Build Installer from Source (on Linux)

```bash
# On Linux with Wine installed:
cd build/windows
bash build_linux.sh
# Creates: output/Pocket-TTS-Setup-1.0.1.exe

# For detailed build instructions, see build/windows/README.md
```

**Requirements:**

- Linux host with `wine64` installed: `sudo apt install wine64`
- `wget` and `unzip` (usually pre-installed)
- ~4 GB disk space
- Internet connection for downloading dependencies

Note:  if using Windows with WSL you might need to install C++ runtime etc.  Use AI to help you if needed.

### Desktop GUI Application

Launch the full-featured audiobook generator with emotion analysis:

```bash
launch.sh
```

**Features:**

- Customizable chunking and emotion settings
- Progress tracking
- Voice cloning from audio prompts
- Individual chunk regeneration for chunk correction

### Smart Text Processing

- **Structure Detection**: Automatic chapter, paragraph, and sentence boundary detection
- **Emotion Analysis**: 6 emotion classes (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, neutral)
- **Intelligent Chunking**: Configurable word limits with boundary respect
- **Parameter Mapping**: Emotion-to-TTS parameter conversion for expressive speech

### Configuration System

Create custom configurations for different content types:

```yaml
# Fiction books - high emotion sensitivity
emotion:
  sensitivity: 1.5
  keyword_boost: 0.3
chunking:
  mode: sentence
  max_words: 80

# Technical docs - neutral, structured
emotion:
  sensitivity: 0.7
chunking:
  mode: paragraph
  max_words: 120
```

Modify the voice with `--voice` and the text with `--text`. We provide a small catalog of voices.

You can take a look at [this page](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/tts-voices) which details the licenses
for each voice.

* [azelma](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/tts-voices/blob/main/vctk/p303_023.wav)

The `--voice` argument can also take a plain wav file as input for voice cloning.
Feel free to check out the [generate documentation](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts/tree/main/docs/generate.md) for more details and examples.
For trying multiple voices and prompts quickly, prefer using the `serve` command.
