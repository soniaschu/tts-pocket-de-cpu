"""Contraction expansion pre-processor for TTS.

This module provides text normalization that expands contractions before
they are tokenized by the SentencePiece tokenizer. This prevents mispronunciation
of contractions like "I'd" (pronounced as "ID").

Usage:
    from pocket_tts.preprocessing.contraction_expander import expand_contractions

    text = "I'd like to go, but I can't."
    expanded = expand_contractions(text)
    # Result: "I would like to go, but I cannot."
